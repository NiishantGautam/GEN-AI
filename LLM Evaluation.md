> Why even care for an LLM Evaluation ?

> We shouldn't blindly trust any model, even from OpenAI. Benchmarking lets us independently test how well a model works for our specific use case. We can spot weaknesses, biases, or errors that might not show up in general tests. 
> This helps us to decide if we n*eed to fine-tune, retrain or even switch models*.


Common Examples Includes:

- **Customer support bots:** Benchmark LLMs to ensure accurate, helpful responses to user queries.
- **Medical Q&A apps:** Test LLMs for correctness and safety in health-related answers.
- **Educational tools:** Evaluate how well LLMs explain concepts or grade student answers.
- **Content moderation:** Check if LLMs can reliably detect harmful or inappropriate content.
- **Legal document analysis:** Benchmark LLMs for summarizing or extracting key info from contracts.



### LLM Benchmarking

Benchmarking is the process of evaluating the performance of a system or component by comparing it against a set of predefined standards or datasets.
With this it is crucial in understanding <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">how well a model performs in various tasks, identifying its strengths and weaknesses, and guiding improvements. </mark>

We have various types of LLM benchmarking. 

- **Factual QA** (like TriviaQA, SQuAD)
- **Multiple-choice reasoning** (like MMLU, ARC)
- **Truthfulness & bias detection** (like TruthfulQA)
- **Perplexity-based evaluation** (language fluency prediction)
- **Semantic similarity** (embedding-based matching)
- **Domain-specific tests** (custom internal benchmarks)


Suppose we select Factual QA and want to go with TriviaQA. We can go to the TriviaQA website to download the full dataset. -  [TriviaQA website](http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/) to download the full dataset. The github link: https://github.com/mandarjoshi90/triviaqa

The dataset contains pairs of questions and answers.

We need to setup our environment for that:

```bash
uv init
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Activates the virtual env

uv add openai # Adds tje fastapi
```
Make sure we add a .gitignore and add that in the .gitignore file
```bash

.venv/

venv/

env/

.env/

virtualenv/
```
